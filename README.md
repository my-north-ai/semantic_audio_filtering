# Sematic Audio Filtering for ASR
Enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition: Effects of Semantic Audio Filtering on Models Performance
![Overview of the Methodology applied](images/READMEIMAGE.png)

### The folders are distributed in the following order: 

Filtering Framework-> All the steps for the creation of the filtering methods of synthetic audio

tts_data_augmentation -> Serves as the folder for all the files and the scripts to create synthetically generated audio

env.example -> example of how the .env file should be structured

## The collection of Whisper Models, which have the best performance in our experiments, is available at :
